# Description

During this project I will be creating an Arduino project and an Java Project. 

The Arduino is getting the current temperature and the current humidity in the room. I am using the Mega 2560 processor and the sensor is the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity module. 

The Java Project gets the data through the serial port and displays it in a Graph. Furthermore the data can be stored in a database.
